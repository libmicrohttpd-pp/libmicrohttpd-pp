libmicrohttpd++
===============

C++11 wrapper around libmicrohttpd (>= 0.9.20).
Not 100% equivalent, some functionality was omitted and some sugar was added.

The intent is the same as libmicrohttpd: provide a bare bones web server that is
suitable for embedded applications and also supports the various server-push
techniques globally known as Comet (infinite-stream, long-polling, ...).

Currently omitted functionality from libmicrohttpd:
- SSL support
- HTTP Authentication support
- Socket polling
- External socket or select()
- Custom unescape callbacks for non-standard URI encodings
Feel free to contribute to the project if you need any of these! ;-)

Although this is a C++11 library, it is restricted to the C++11 subset actually
supported by GCC 4.4 (in order to support Debian Squeeze) so if you feel like
contributing please make sure your code respects this restriction.
